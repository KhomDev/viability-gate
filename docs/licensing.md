# Licensing

## Current state

| Path | Contents | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `src/**` | Rust source | **MIT** |
| `tests/**` | Test code and fixtures | **MIT** |
| `scripts/**` | Python tooling | **MIT** |
| `tools/**` | The calibration harness | **MIT** |
| `rules/anti-patterns.yaml` | The anti-pattern catalog (data) | **MIT** |
| `rules/gates.yaml` | The gate definitions (data) | **MIT** |
| `rules/packs/**` | Ecosystem token packs (data) | **MIT** |
| `docs/**`, `README.md` | Documentation | **MIT** |
| `examples/**` | Synthetic fixtures | **MIT** |

The repository `LICENSE` is the MIT licence and it is the only licence text in
the tree. There is no per-directory licence file and no `SPDX-License-Identifier`
header anywhere.

## `rules/*.yaml` is covered (resolved in 0.3.0)

Up to 0.2.0 this was an open question: the catalog is data rather than code, and
a reader who wanted to reuse it could reasonably ask whether a licence that reads
as a software licence was meant to cover a data file.

It was. The **Scope** paragraph in `README.md`'s License section now says so: the
MIT grant covers the entire repository, including `rules/` and `docs/`, and the
catalog may be extracted, shipped as a ruleset in another tool, or adapted under
the same terms. The catalog is the author's original work, derived from the
author's own rejection log. The classified log is published separately in
[rejection-taxonomy](https://github.com/KhomDev/rejection-taxonomy), whose terms
this licence does not change. No second licence file was added.

## What is deliberately not bundled

The tool ships **no** third-party data:

- No program names, no chain names, no reward tables.
- No rejection log. The 97-row dataset lives in
  [rejection-taxonomy](https://github.com/KhomDev/rejection-taxonomy) under its
  own licence and is not vendored here.
- No prior-audit PDFs and no known-issues corpora. Those are user inputs
  (`--known-issues`), supplied at runtime and never redistributed.
- No control set. [`docs/control-set.md`](control-set.md) explains how to build
  one from public paid reports; fetching one into this repository is a stop gate.

That is why there is no `NOTICE` file and no third-party licence inventory: the
only third-party code is the crate graph, and `cargo` resolves and reports those
licences directly (`cargo deny check licenses` in CI).
